# Hola! 🤙 I'm Rodrigo Yrigoyen

## About me

I have degrees at Systems engineering and Media production for advertising and over 12 years of experience working as a full stack development and UX/UI designer.

> I belive design and development should be understood as a whole.

- 💻 Currently working on [pinkxel.com](https://pinkxel.com) digital design studio.
- 🤖 Learning **Data science and artificial intelligence**.
- 🎨 Ask me about what I've learned mixing both **design and development** disciplines.
- 🌎 My goal is to **inspire the world** working with avant-garde technologies and trends.
